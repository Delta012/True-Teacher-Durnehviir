# True Teacher Durnehviir

True Teacher Durnehviir is a simple script replacer which allows you to unlock Summon Durnehviir Words without spending Dragon Souls.
After the fight with Durnehviir, he says that will grant you the right to call his name, but then only teaches you the Words of Power, instead of sharing his knowledge to use them too. Considering that the same doesn't happen with Call Dragon, I've fixed that.
